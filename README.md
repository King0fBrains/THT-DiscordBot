# THT-DiscordBot 
In progress work for the discord bot ran in The High Table discord server. 
This bot is going to be hardcoded for the THT discord server. It will also be an absolute mess.
### Where to Find Me
If you have any questions, please join THT and ping me in the general chat.
## Installation Instructions
For the time being, this will only cover windows, as the bot has not developed enough to warrant hosting on a VPS.

1. Download the zip file of this repository.
2. Create a file called "token.txt". Inside of it place your discord token.
3. Install the latest version of python.
4. Run this command `python -m venv /venv`.
5. Run this command `\venv\Scripts\activate`.
6. Run this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Start the bot.

## Contributors
I have to thank [@10BenAgain](https://github.com/10BenAgain) for inspiring me to learn python.

#### Whoops
As stated above this project is a mess. Here will be where I document all of the stupid things that have happened so far.
- Yes there is an old bot token in the commit history. No it does not work. The bot has infact been changed since then to not require a hardcoded token. It happened when I changed the repository from private to public. Remember to check your commit history.
