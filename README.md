# THT-DiscordBot 
In progress work for the discord bot ran in The High Table discord server.

Note: This bot is going to be hardcoded for the THT discord server. It will also be an absolute mess.
### Where to Find Me
If you have any questions, please join THT and ping me in the general chat.
## Installation Instructions
For the time being, this will only cover windows, as the bot has not developed enough to warrant hosting on a VPS.

1. Download the zip file of this repository.
2. Create a file called "token.txt". Inside of it place your discord token.
3. Install the latest version of python.
4. Run this command `python -m venv /venv`.
5. Run this command `\venv\Scripts\activate`.
6. Run this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Start the bot.
